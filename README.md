# LectureRecordingPlayer
Android Lecture Recording Player/Manager for the University of Auckland. My first Android App and experience with Kotlin
* Automatically scrapes lecture recording links from loaded webpages
* Syncs lecture recordings with the [Canvas Video Enhancer](https://github.com/ChineseElectricPanda/canvas-video-enhancer) playlist system server
* Parses lecture recording data (course, date, name) and stores it in a list for browsing (with filtering and sorting)
* Authenticates with UoA SSO and downloads lecture recordings for offline playback
* Playback lecture recordings (using installed apps, custom player todo)
### Future todo
* ~~Better recording management (course grouping etc.)~~
* Faster scraping, page depth > 1 scraping
* Support for multiresolution downloading
* Streaming
* Custom recording player (gain, speed controls)
